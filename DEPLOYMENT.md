# Deployment Configuration for Enhanced KNUST Chatbot

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Environment Variables Required:
```bash
# Firebase Configuration
FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS={"type":"service_account",...}

# OpenAI Configuration  
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Server Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000

# Firebase API Key for Authentication
FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIza...
```

### Build Process:
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci --production

# Start application
npm start
```

### Health Checks:
- **Health Endpoint**: `/health`
- **API Documentation**: `/api-docs`
- **Program Count Validation**: Should load 98 programs

### Performance Monitoring:
- Monitor Firestore connection status
- Track OpenAI API usage and response times
- Monitor fuzzy search performance for query classification

### Security Considerations:
- All endpoints require JWT authentication except health checks
- Firebase Admin SDK handles user verification
- Sensitive data (API keys) stored in environment variables only

### Mobile App Integration:
- Enhanced search endpoints ready for mobile consumption
- Chat history persistence enabled
- User management endpoints available
- Career vs admission query classification active

### Testing in Production:
```bash
# Test Computer Science recognition
curl -X POST /chat -d '{"message":"What are career opportunities in computer science?"}'

# Test enhanced search
curl -X GET '/programs/search?query=computer&college=College of Science'

# Test user management
curl -X GET /profile -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```
