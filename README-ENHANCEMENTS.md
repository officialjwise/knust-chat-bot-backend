# KNUST Chatbot Backend - Enhanced Version

## Overview
This enhanced version of the KNUST Chatbot Backend implements strict dataset-scoped responses, fuzzy search capabilities, and improved program matching to ensure accurate admission information.

## 🚀 Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Dataset-Only Responses for Admission Queries
- **Pre-check middleware**: Detects admission-related queries using keywords like "cut off", "fees", "program", "requirements", etc.
- **Bypass GPT for dataset queries**: Direct responses from `data.js` for cut-offs, fees, and requirements
- **Strict GPT prompting**: When GPT is used, it's constrained to KNUST-only information
- **Response filtering**: Post-processes GPT responses to remove non-KNUST program mentions

### 2. Fuzzy Search for Program Names
- **Fuzzy matching**: Uses `fuse.js` library for intelligent program name matching
- **Handles typos**: "computer science" → "BSc Computer Science"
- **Partial names**: "petroleum" → "BSc Petroleum Engineering" 
- **Multiple suggestions**: When ambiguous, provides list of possible matches
- **No exact match required**: Users don't need to type "BSc" prefix

### 3. Auto-Suggestion for Ambiguous Queries
```javascript
// Example response for "computer"
{
  "response": "I found multiple programs that might match your query. Did you mean one of these?\n\n1. BSc Computer Science\n2. BSc Computer Engineering\n\nPlease specify which program you're interested in."
}
```

### 4. Auto-Append Admission Requirements
- **Eligibility queries**: For questions like "Can I pursue Computer Science with General Arts?"
- **Automatic addition**: After answering yes/no, automatically shows:
  - Cut-off point
  - Required SHS subjects  
  - Fee structure
- **Background checking**: Matches user's SHS background against program requirements

### 5. Dataset-Only Recommendations
- **Similar programs**: Based on cut-off points (±3 tolerance)
- **Filtered results**: Only suggests programs from `data.js`
- **Smart exclusion**: Doesn't recommend the same program user asked about

### 6. Hardcoded Non-Admission Responses
```javascript
// Examples:
"Who created you?" → "I was created by Rockson Agyamaku to assist with KNUST admission information."
"Hello" → "Hello! I'm here to help you with KNUST admission information..."
```

## 📁 New Files Added

### `chatbot-utils.js`
Core utility functions for enhanced chatbot functionality:
- `isAdmissionQuery()`: Detects admission-related queries
- `checkNonAdmissionQuery()`: Returns hardcoded responses for non-admission queries
- `fuzzySearchPrograms()`: Fuzzy search using fuse.js
- `extractProgramName()`: Intelligent program name extraction
- `generateDatasetResponse()`: Creates responses directly from dataset
- `findSimilarPrograms()`: Finds programs with similar cut-offs
- `checkEligibilityByBackground()`: Checks SHS background compatibility

### `test-chatbot.js`
Comprehensive test script to verify all enhancements work correctly.

## 🔧 Updated Files

### `routes.js`
- Enhanced `/chat` endpoint with multi-step processing
- Response filtering middleware
- Improved error handling
- Test endpoint for fuzzy search (`/test-fuzzy-search/:query`)

### `package.json`
- Added `fuse.js` dependency for fuzzy search

## 🎯 Query Processing Flow

1. **Non-admission check**: Handle greetings, creator questions, etc.
2. **Program extraction**: Use fuzzy search to identify mentioned programs
3. **Ambiguity handling**: Suggest multiple matches if unclear
4. **Admission query detection**: Determine if query needs dataset-only response
5. **Dataset response**: Generate direct response from `data.js` for admission queries
6. **GPT fallback**: Use constrained GPT for general guidance with dataset context
7. **Response filtering**: Remove any non-KNUST program mentions
8. **Auto-append**: Add admission requirements for eligibility questions

## 📊 Example Interactions

### Before Enhancement:
```
User: "computer science cut off"
Bot: "Computer Science programs typically require..." (uses general knowledge)
```

### After Enhancement:
```
User: "computer science cut off"
Bot: "**BSc Computer Science**
🎯 Cut-off Point: 7
🏫 College: College of Science
📚 Required SHS Subjects:
• Physics
• Mathematics  
• Choose one: Chemistry OR Applied Electricity OR Electronics"
```

### Fuzzy Search Examples:
```
"petroleum" → BSc Petroleum Engineering
"civil eng" → BSc Civil Engineering  
"nursing" → BSc Nursing
"economics" → BA Economics
"law" → Suggests: LLB (if multiple matches)
```

### Eligibility Queries:
```
User: "Can I pursue Computer Science with General Arts?"
Bot: "Unfortunately, BSc Computer Science requires specific science subjects that are typically not available in General Arts. Here are the requirements:

📋 BSc Computer Science - Admission Details:
🎯 Cut-off Point: 7
🏫 College: College of Science
📚 Required SHS Subjects:
• Physics
• Mathematics
• Choose one: Chemistry OR Applied Electricity OR Electronics"
```

## 🛡️ Data Integrity Features

- **Strict dataset boundaries**: Never suggests programs not in `data.js`
- **Institution filtering**: Removes mentions of other universities (UG, UCC, etc.)
- **Program validation**: Verifies all program mentions against official KNUST catalog
- **Conservative responses**: When uncertain, asks for clarification

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
node test-chatbot.js
```

Test fuzzy search via API:
```bash
GET /test-fuzzy-search/computer
```

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

1. Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in environment variables
2. All responses now stay within KNUST dataset boundaries
3. Fuzzy search improves user experience significantly
4. Response times are faster for dataset-only queries (bypass GPT)
5. More accurate and reliable admission information

## 🔍 Monitoring

The system now logs:
- Program extraction results
- Fuzzy search matches
- Dataset vs GPT response decisions
- Response filtering actions

This enhanced version ensures users always get accurate, official KNUST admission information while providing a much better user experience through intelligent program matching and comprehensive responses.
