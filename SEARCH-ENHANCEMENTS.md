# KNUST Chatbot Backend - Enhanced Search System

## âœ… ISSUES FIXED:

### 1. **Search Results for "Computer" Programs**
**Before**: Mobile app showed "no search results" for "computer"
**After**: Returns both Computer Engineering and Computer Science programs

### 2. **College Filtering Accuracy**  
**Before**: College filtering was broken (checking `college.length > 0` on string)
**After**: Proper college filtering that correctly matches programs to their colleges

### 3. **Correct College Assignments**
âœ… **BSc Computer Engineering** â†’ College of Engineering  
âœ… **BSc Computer Science** â†’ College of Science

### 4. **Enhanced Search Logic**
**Before**: Simple string matching with PDF data structure
**After**: Multi-strategy search with fuzzy matching

## ðŸš€ NEW SEARCH FEATURES:

### **Enhanced Search Endpoint**: `GET /programs/search`
**Parameters:**
- `query` (string): Search term for program names
- `college` (string): Filter by college name

**Search Strategy:**
1. **College Filtering First**: If college specified, filter programs by college
2. **Exact Matching**: Find programs with exact name matches
3. **Fuzzy Search**: If few exact matches, add fuzzy matches for better results
4. **Relevance Sorting**: Exact matches first, then by competitiveness (cut-off)

### **New College Endpoints**:
- `GET /colleges` - Get all colleges with program counts
- `GET /colleges/:collegeName/programs` - Get all programs for a specific college

## ðŸ“Š TEST RESULTS:

### **Search: "computer" (no college filter)**
âœ… Returns: Computer Engineering + Computer Science (both colleges)

### **Search: "computer" + College of Engineering filter**  
âœ… Returns: Only Computer Engineering

### **Search: "computer" + College of Science filter**
âœ… Returns: Only Computer Science

### **Search: "engineering" + College of Engineering filter**
âœ… Returns: All 18 engineering programs from College of Engineering

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS:

### **Data Source**:
- **Before**: Used inconsistent `pdfData?.programs` structure
- **After**: Uses clean `validPrograms` from `data.js` with `getProgramData()`

### **Error Handling**:
- Proper logging of search criteria
- Informative error messages with search criteria
- Graceful handling of no results

### **Response Format**:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "bsc_computer_science",
      "name": "BSc Computer Science", 
      "description": "A program offered by College of Science at KNUST.",
      "college": "College of Science",
      "cutoff": 7,
      "requirements": "Core: Mathematics, English, Science; Electives: Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry OR Applied Electricity OR Electronics",
      "fees": {
        "regular_freshers": 2748.3,
        "fee_paying_freshers": 6937.45,
        "residential_freshers": 2167.8
      }
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "searchCriteria": {
    "query": "computer",
    "college": "College of Science"
  }
}
```

### **Mobile App Integration**:
- Unique IDs for each program
- Detailed program information including fees and requirements
- College information for proper categorization
- Search criteria echoed back for debugging

## ðŸ§ª TESTING SCENARIOS:

### **Scenario 1**: Search "computer" without filter
- **Expected**: Both Computer Engineering and Computer Science
- **Result**: âœ… PASS - Returns both programs from different colleges

### **Scenario 2**: Search "computer" with "College of Engineering"
- **Expected**: Only Computer Engineering
- **Result**: âœ… PASS - Returns only Computer Engineering

### **Scenario 3**: Search "computer" with "College of Science"  
- **Expected**: Only Computer Science
- **Result**: âœ… PASS - Returns only Computer Science

### **Scenario 4**: Search with invalid college
- **Expected**: No results with clear error message
- **Result**: âœ… PASS - Returns appropriate error

## ðŸ“± MOBILE APP IMPACT:

### **Fixed Issues**:
1. âœ… "Computer" search now returns results
2. âœ… College filtering works correctly  
3. âœ… Programs show correct college associations
4. âœ… Both Computer Engineering and Computer Science are discoverable

### **Enhanced Features**:
1. ðŸ†• Better search relevance with fuzzy matching
2. ðŸ†• College-specific program browsing
3. ðŸ†• Detailed program information in search results
4. ðŸ†• Improved error handling and user feedback

## ðŸ”„ API ENDPOINTS READY FOR TESTING:

- `GET /programs/search?query=computer` - Search all computer programs
- `GET /programs/search?query=computer&college=College of Engineering` - Engineering only
- `GET /programs/search?query=computer&college=College of Science` - Science only
- `GET /colleges` - Get all colleges with counts
- `GET /colleges/College%20of%20Engineering/programs` - All engineering programs

The search system is now robust, accurate, and ready for mobile app integration! ðŸš€
