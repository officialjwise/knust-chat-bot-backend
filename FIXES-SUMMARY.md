# KNUST Chatbot Backend - Issues Fixed

## Issues Addressed:

### 1. âœ… Computer Science Recognition Issue
**Problem**: Bot wasn't properly recognizing "Computer Science" queries and distinguishing between admission vs career questions.

**Solution**: 
- Improved query classification with `isCareerAcademicQuery()` function
- Added specific handling for career/academic questions vs admission queries
- Enhanced fuzzy search with special case handling for "Computer Science"
- Added step-by-step logic flow in chat endpoint

**Test Cases**:
- âœ… "What is the cut-off for Computer Science?" â†’ Returns dataset info (admission query)
- âœ… "What are career opportunities in computer science?" â†’ Uses GPT for career info
- âœ… "Tell me about computer science program" â†’ Uses GPT for academic info

### 2. âœ… Password Reset Email Issue
**Problem**: Password reset wasn't sending actual emails.

**Solution**:
- Updated `/forgot-password` endpoint to use Firebase Admin's `generatePasswordResetLink()`
- Added proper error handling for user-not-found and invalid-email cases
- Returns reset link in development mode for testing
- Improved error messages

### 3. âœ… Chat History Persistence
**Problem**: Chat messages weren't being saved to user's history.

**Solution**:
- Added `saveChatMessage()` helper function
- Created `/chat-history` endpoint to retrieve chat history
- Created `/chat-history` DELETE endpoint to clear history
- Updated chat endpoint to save all user messages and bot responses
- Chat history is organized by user UID with timestamps

**New Endpoints**:
- `GET /chat-history` - Retrieve user's chat history with pagination
- `DELETE /chat-history` - Clear user's chat history

### 4. âœ… User Management System
**Problem**: Missing user profile and aggregate management endpoints.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive user management endpoints:

**New Endpoints**:
- `GET /profile` - Get user profile information
- `PUT /profile` - Update user profile (firstName, lastName, phone, shs, currentLevel, program)
- `POST /calculate-aggregate` - Calculate and save user's aggregate to profile
- `GET /eligible-programs` - Get programs user is eligible for based on their aggregate

### 5. âœ… Enhanced Query Classification
**Problem**: Bot couldn't distinguish between different types of queries properly.

**Solution**:
- Added `CAREER_ACADEMIC_KEYWORDS` for non-admission questions
- Improved `isAdmissionQuery()` logic to exclude career questions
- Added step-by-step query processing in chat endpoint:
  1. Check non-admission hardcoded responses
  2. Detect career/academic queries
  3. Extract program names
  4. Classify admission vs career intent
  5. Handle accordingly with appropriate AI model or dataset

## Implementation Details:

### Query Flow:
1. **Non-admission queries** (greetings, bot info) â†’ Hardcoded responses
2. **Career/Academic + Program** â†’ GPT with career-focused prompt
3. **Admission + Program** â†’ Dataset response with program details
4. **Ambiguous queries** â†’ Program suggestions
5. **General admission** â†’ GPT with strict dataset context
6. **General non-admission** â†’ Helpful guidance

### Error Handling:
- Improved password reset error messages
- Added validation for user profile updates
- Enhanced error logging throughout the system
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

### Data Persistence:
- All chat interactions saved to Firestore
- User profiles with last aggregate calculation
- Chat history organized by user with timestamps
- FAQ collection for analytics

## Testing Status:
- âœ… Query classification working correctly
- âœ… Computer Science recognition fixed
- âœ… Server starts without errors
- ðŸ”„ API endpoints ready for testing (requires authentication)

## Next Steps:
1. Test with real authentication tokens
2. Verify password reset email delivery in production
3. Test mobile app integration with new chat history endpoints
4. Monitor query classification accuracy with real users
